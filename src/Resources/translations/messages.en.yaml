            <h4>Understanding synonyms</h4>
            <p>Synonyms are words or phrases that have the same or similar meaning. For example, if you add the synonym "jacket" to the term "coat", then when a user searches for "coat", the search results will include results matching "jacket".</p>
            <p>If the direction is "one way", then the synonym will only work in one direction. For example, if the term is "coat" and the synonym is "jacket", then when a user searches for "coat", the search results will include results matching "jacket". However, if the direction is "two way", then the synonym will work in both directions. For example when a user searches for "jacket", the search results will include results matching "coat", and when a user searches for "coat", the search results will include results matching "jacket".</p>
